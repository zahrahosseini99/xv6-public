Add a new system call to xv6 that can be used when you try to implement your scheduler functions.
The first step is to extend the current proc structure and add new fields stime, etime, iotime and rtime for
start time, end-time, I/O time and total time respectively of a process. 
When a new process gets created the kernel code should update the process creation time.
The run-time should get updated after, for the process.
To extract this information from the kernel add a new system call which wait.
